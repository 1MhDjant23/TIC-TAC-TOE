# TIC-TAC-TOE

An interactive tic-tac-toe game where players can compete against each other in the classic 3x3 grid game.

## 📝 About the Game

Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## 🎮 Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid
2. Two players take turns placing their marks (X or O)
3. Player 1 uses "X" and Player 2 uses "O"
4. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
5. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw
